1. When docker installed by default docker installs 3 networks by default :
   a. bridge
   b. none
   c. host

2. Bridge is default network where a container gets attached to. 

docker run ubuntu --network=<network-name>  ex:- none, host

docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 182.3.4.5/16 custom isolated network : It will create custom network on docker. 

docker network ls : It will show all networks on docker 

Within docker containers reach each other using containers name. 

docker built in DNS server always runs at 127.0.0.11
