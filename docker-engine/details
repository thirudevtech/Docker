1. docker engine is nothing but docker host where we are installing docker. 
2. docker installation includes componenets like :
   a. docker deamon.
   b. rest api
   c. docker cli

3. docker deamon is background process that manages docker objects such as Imaages, Containers, Volumes and Networks. 
4. rest api is server api interface that programes can be used to talk to deamon and provide instructions. 
5. docker cli is command line interface to perform actions on images, continers, dockerfile. It uses rest api to interact with docker deamon. 
6. docker cli need not to be on same docker host, we can connect to remote docker api using below command :
   docker -H=remote-docker-engine(dcoker host ip-address):port-number(2375)
7. docker uses namespaces to isolate workspace ( process-id, network, interprocess, mount and Unix-timesharing ) are created in their own namespace
   there by providing isolation between containers.
8. docker uses cgroups to restrict the amount of hardware resources allocates to each continer. 

   docker run --cpus=.5 ubuntu  : It runs ubuntu continer utilizing 50% of docker host cpus. 
   dokcer run --memory=100m ubuntu
