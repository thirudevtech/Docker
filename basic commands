------------
CONTAINER :
------------

docker ps                            : To list running containers
docker ps -a                         : To list all containers
docker run <image-name>              : To run docker container from Image-name
docker run -it <image-name> bash     : To run docker container from Image-name and enter into container console
docker run <image-name> command      : executing command when we run container (example for command : sleep 5 )
dokcer exec <container-name> command : executing command on running container (example for command : cat /etc/hosts)


NOTE: docker looks for image locally if it's not found it will get from docker hub.

docker run -d <image-name>                       : To run docker conatiner in detached mode (which runs in background)
docker attach <container-id or container-name>   : To attach to conatiner which is in detached mode (which runs in background)
docker stop <container-id or container-name>     : To stop or kill running container
docker rm <container-name>                       : To remove container permanently

NOTE : It should print container name back so that we are good.
NOTE : We can use first 4 digits of container-id in place of conatiner-id. 

----------
IMAGES :
----------

docker images            : To list images
docker rmi <image-name>  : To remove image
NOTE : Make sure no conatiner are running half of this image. If any containers running half of this image you should stop conatiner and 
       delete it.
       
docker pull <image-name> : To pull docker image into local

NOTE : Unlike VM'S containers are not meant to host operating system, Containers are meant to run specific task or process.
