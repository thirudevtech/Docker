1. with docker installation we get default file system as below :
   var/lib/docker
   -- aufs
      containers
      image
      volumes

docker volume create test-folder : It will create test-folder under volumes folder. 

VOLUME-MOUNTING :

2. docker will automatically create folder under volumes folder if it is not existed by the time we are mounting volume to some other container. 

BIND-MOUNTING :

3. If we want to mount some other data staorage folder on docker host other than default folder( volumes ) to docker container,
   we need to use below command :
   dcoker run -v <provide entire folder path on docker-host>:<path on container> <image-name> 

LATEST COMMAND :

docker run --mount type=bind, source=<folder on docker host>, target=<folder on container>

COMMON STORAGE DRIVERS :

AUFS
ZFS
BTRFS
Device mapper
Overlay
Overlay2

Above storage driver selection depends on OS we use. 

docker info  : This command will show details of docker installed on docker host. 

docker system df : It will show actual disk usage of docker

docker system de -v : Will give individual disk usage.
